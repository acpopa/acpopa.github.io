# Astrophysics and Space Science Student

I am an Erasmus Mundus Joint Master student in Astrophysics and Space Science at the Universit√† degli Studi di Roma "Tor Vergata" under an EMJM scholarship awarded by the European Union through European Education and Culture Executive Agency (EACEA). I am currently taking courses in Quantum Mechanics, Modern Astrophysics, Mathematical Methods, Radiative Processes and Numerical Methods.

I completed my undergraduate education with a integradated degree in Physics at University College London, focusing on Astronomy and Astrophysics in the final year. Previously, I also worked at Northeastern University London as part of their Residence Life Services Department and at University of London as part of their Intercollegiate Halls Services Department . Originally, I come from a small town in Romania.
