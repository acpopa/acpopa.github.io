Education
======
* MSc in Astrophysics and Space Science,  Università degli Studi di Roma "Tor Vergata", 2026 (expected)
* M.Sci. in Physics, University College London, UK, 2022

Work experience
======
* MSci Project: Hunting for Intermediate‑Mass Black Hole Binaries
 * UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON, London, UK                                           Oct. 2021‑ March. 2022
 * Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBH) are still one of the big mysteries in astronomy and astrophysics as so far there is no evidence of the existence of black holes with masses between 100 M⊙ and105 M⊙.
    * Supervised byProf. Daisuke Kawata‑ analysing the behaviour of IMBHs and investigating their interaction with a stellar companion.
    * Literature review of detection methods for black holes, focussing on non‑interacting binary systems composed of a black hole and a star.
    * Calculations of physical constraints of the orbital parameters and inspection of star viability based on its stellar classification
    * Developed custom Python code to automate mass analysis for binary system and produce astrometric tracks for IMBH‑star systems.
    * Correlating the results with the ongoing mission results such as Gaia and making prediction for the upcoming JASMINE mission.

======

* GroupProject: VOC Analysis For Disease Detection: A Critical Assessment Of Non‑Invasive Screening Methods
 * UNIVERSITY COLLEGE LONDON, London, UK                                             Jan. 2021‑ Mar. 2021
 * Achieved 76.81% in the third‑year Physics group project, investigating the real potential of volatile organic compounds as a better non‑invasive detection method of COVID‑19 and various other bio‑markers.
    * Supervised byProf. Gaetana Laricchia‑ analysing volatile organic compounds for medical diagnostics.
    * Literature review of promising detection methods such as ion mobility spectrometry, electronic noses or MALDI.
    * Performed analysis of various diseases which emit bio‑markers in the form of VOCs such as cancers, COVID‑19 or Alzheimer’s disease.
    * Produced group project, poster, and presentation, including a new device proposal for quickly detecting VOCs
